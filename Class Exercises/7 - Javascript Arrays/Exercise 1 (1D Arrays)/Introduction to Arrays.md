__Introduction__ 

The example program accepts 5 students names and grades in two separate 1D arrays. You can either enter the data manually or load up the sample data. The program will then calculate the max, min and average scores.

__Exercise__

1. Write a program which allows the user to enter 5 employeesâ€™ surnames together with the amount earned per week.  The program should then display the name and amount earned of the employee earning the most and least together with the total weekly wage bill.

2.	Write a program which generates 50 random numbers in the range 1 to 10 and places them in an array.  The program should then display the number of times 1 and 10 occur, together with the total number of times a number in the range 1 to 5 is generated and the average of the 50 numbers.
