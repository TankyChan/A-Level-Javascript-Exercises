# Image Resizer

## Exercise
Create a program that allows users to manipulate an image on the page:
1. Change the width of the image
2. Change the height of the image
3. Move the image left/right (margin-left)
4. Move the image up/down (margin-top)

The page should have:
- Input fields for width and height (in pixels)
- Input fields for horizontal and vertical position
- A preview area showing the image being manipulated
- Display of current values

## Requirements
- Use number inputs for dimensions and positions
- Update the image immediately when values change
- Show current values below the image
- Use JavaScript to change the style properties
- Keep the image within reasonable size limits (e.g., 50px to 500px)

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding CSS dimensions and positioning
- Working with pixel values in CSS
- Updating multiple style properties at once
- Reading numeric input values and applying them to styles
