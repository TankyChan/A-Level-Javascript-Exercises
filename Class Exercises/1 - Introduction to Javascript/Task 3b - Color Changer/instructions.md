# Color Changer

## Exercise
Create a program that allows users to change the colors of different elements on the page:
1. A main heading that can have its text color changed
2. A paragraph that can have its background color changed
3. A box that can have both its border color and background color changed

The page should have:
- Color input fields for each changeable property
- A preview area showing the elements being changed
- Text showing the current color values

## Requirements
- Use the color input type for color selection
- Update the colors immediately when a color is selected
- Display the selected color values (in hex format) below each element
- Use JavaScript to change the style properties of the elements

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding CSS manipulation through JavaScript
- Working with color inputs
- Updating multiple CSS properties
- Reading input values and applying them to styles
