# Practice: Inheritance 4

Complete the code to create:
- A `Shape` class with a constructor that takes a `name`.
- A `Circle` class that extends `Shape` and adds a `radius` property and an `area()` method (area = πr²).

Test your classes by creating a circle and calling its `area()` method.

**Focus only on inheritance, constructor chaining, and method extension.**
