# Practice: Basic Class

Complete the code to create a `Book` class with:
- A constructor that takes a `title` and `author`.
- A method `getInfo()` that returns a string like: "Title by Author".

Test your class by creating a new `Book` and displaying its info.

**Focus only on the class, constructor, and method.**
