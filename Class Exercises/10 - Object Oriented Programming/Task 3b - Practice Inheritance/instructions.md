# Practice: Inheritance 2

Complete the code to create:
- A `Vehicle` class with a constructor that takes a `make`.
- A `Car` class that extends `Vehicle` and adds a `honk()` method that returns a string like: "Toyota goes beep!".

Test your classes by creating a car and calling its `honk()` method.

**Focus only on inheritance and method extension.**
