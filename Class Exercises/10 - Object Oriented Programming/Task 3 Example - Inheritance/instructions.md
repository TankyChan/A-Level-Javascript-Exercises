# OOP Example: Inheritance

This example shows how one class (Dog) can inherit from another (Animal).

- The `Dog` class uses `extends` to inherit from `Animal`.
- The `super` keyword calls the parent class's constructor.
- The `Dog` class can override methods (like `speak`) and add its own (like `getInfo`).
