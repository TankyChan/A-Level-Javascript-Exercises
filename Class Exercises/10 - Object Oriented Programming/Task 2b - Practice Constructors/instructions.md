# Practice: Constructors 2

Complete the code to create a `Student` class with:
- A constructor that takes a `name` and `year`, with default values if not provided.
- A method `getInfo()` that returns a string like: "Name (Year)".

Test your class by creating a default student and a custom student.

**Focus only on the constructor and method.**
