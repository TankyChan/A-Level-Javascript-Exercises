# Practice: Inheritance 3

Complete the code to create:
- A `Person` class with a constructor that takes a `name`.
- A `Student` class that extends `Person` and adds a `study()` method that returns a string like: "Ava is studying!".

Test your classes by creating a student and calling its `study()` method.

**Focus only on inheritance and method extension.**
