# Practice: Encapsulation 4

Complete the code to create a `Safe` class with:
- A private `#code` field (use `#` for private fields in JS).
- A `setCode(code)` method to set the code.
- An `unlock(guess)` method that returns "Unlocked!" if the guess is correct, otherwise "Wrong code!".

Test your class by setting and unlocking the safe.

**Focus only on private fields and encapsulation.**
