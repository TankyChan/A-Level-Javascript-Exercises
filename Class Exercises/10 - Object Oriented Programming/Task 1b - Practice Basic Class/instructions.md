# Practice: Basic Class 2

Complete the code to create a `Movie` class with:
- A constructor that takes a `title` and `year`.
- A method `getInfo()` that returns a string like: "Title (Year)".

Test your class by creating a new `Movie` and displaying its info.

**Focus only on the class, constructor, and method.**
