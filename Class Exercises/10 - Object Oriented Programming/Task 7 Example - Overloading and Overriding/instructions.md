# OOP Example: Overloading and Overriding

This example shows:
- **Overriding:** The `AdvancedCalculator` class overrides the `add` method from `Calculator`.
- **Overloading (simulated):** JavaScript doesn't support true method overloading, but you can check the number of arguments to change behavior.

Try clicking the button to see the results of calling `add` with one or two arguments!

---

**Explore:**
- Add another method to the calculator and try overriding it.
- Try calling `add` with different numbers of arguments.
