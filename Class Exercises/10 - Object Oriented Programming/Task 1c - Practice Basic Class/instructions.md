# Practice: Basic Class 3

Complete the code to create a `City` class with:
- A constructor that takes a `name` and `population`.
- A method `getInfo()` that returns a string like: "Name has Population people".

Test your class by creating a new `City` and displaying its info.

**Focus only on the class, constructor, and method.**
