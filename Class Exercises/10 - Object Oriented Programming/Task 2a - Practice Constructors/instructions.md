# Practice: Constructors

Complete the code to create a `Car` class with:
- A constructor that takes a `make` and `model`, with default values if not provided.
- A method `getInfo()` that returns a string like: "Make Model".

Test your class by creating a default car and a custom car.

**Focus only on the constructor and method.**
