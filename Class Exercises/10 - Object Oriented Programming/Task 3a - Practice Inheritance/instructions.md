# Practice: Inheritance 1

Complete the code to create:
- An `Animal` class with a constructor that takes a `name`.
- A `Dog` class that extends `Animal` and adds a `bark()` method that returns a string like: "Rex says woof!".

Test your classes by creating a dog and calling its `bark()` method.

**Focus only on inheritance and method extension.**
