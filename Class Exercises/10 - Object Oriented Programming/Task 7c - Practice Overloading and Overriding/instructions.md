# Practice: Overloading & Overriding 3

Complete the code to create:
- A `Joiner` class with a `join(a, b)` method.
- An `AdvancedJoiner` class that extends `Joiner` and overrides `join(a, b)`.
- In `AdvancedJoiner`, if only one argument is given, return `a + a`. If two arguments, return `a + b`.

Test your classes by calling `join()` with one and two arguments.

**Focus on method overriding and using optional parameters for overloading.**
