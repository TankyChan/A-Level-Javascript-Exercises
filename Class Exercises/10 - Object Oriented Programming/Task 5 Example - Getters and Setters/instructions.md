# OOP Example: Getters and Setters

This example shows how to use get and set methods to control access to a property.

- The `Student` class has a `grade` property with a getter and setter.
- The setter only allows grades between 0 and 100.
- Try clicking the buttons to see and change the grade!

**Explore:**
- Add a getter for a "pass/fail" message based on the grade.
- Try setting an invalid grade (like -10 or 200) and see what happens.
