# Practice: Getters & Setters 4

Complete the code to create a `Circle` class with:
- A `radius` property.
- A getter for `diameter` that returns the diameter (radius Ã— 2).
- A setter for `diameter` that sets the radius.

Test your class by setting the diameter and getting the radius.

**Focus on getter/setter logic.**
