# OOP Example: Encapsulation

This example shows how to use private fields (with `#`) to keep data safe inside a class.

- The `BankAccount` class has a private `#balance` field.
- You can only change the balance using the `deposit` and `withdraw` methods.
- The balance can't be changed directly from outside the class.

Try clicking the button to see how the balance changes!

- Try adding a method to show an error if you try to withdraw too much.
- Add a method to show the account owner's name.
