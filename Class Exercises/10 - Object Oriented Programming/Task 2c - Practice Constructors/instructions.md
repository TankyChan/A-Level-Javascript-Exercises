# Practice: Constructors 3

Complete the code to create a `Pet` class with:
- A constructor that takes a `name` and `type` (e.g., "dog", "cat").
- A method `describe()` that returns a string like: "Name is a Type".

Test your class by creating a dog and a cat.

**Focus only on the constructor and method.**
