# Practice: Overloading & Overriding 2

Complete the code to create:
- A `Greeter` class with a `greet(name)` method.
- An `AdvancedGreeter` class that extends `Greeter` and overrides `greet(name)`.
- In `AdvancedGreeter`, if no name is given, return "Hello, friend!". If a name is given, return "Hello, name!".

Test your classes by calling `greet()` with and without a name.

**Focus on method overriding and using optional parameters for overloading.**
