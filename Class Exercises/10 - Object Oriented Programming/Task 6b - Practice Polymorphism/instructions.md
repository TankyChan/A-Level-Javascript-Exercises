# Practice: Polymorphism 2

Complete the code to create:
- A `Shape` class with an `area()` method.
- `Rectangle` and `Circle` classes that extend `Shape` and override `area()`.

Test your classes by calling `area()` on both a rectangle and a circle.

**Focus on method overriding and polymorphism.**
