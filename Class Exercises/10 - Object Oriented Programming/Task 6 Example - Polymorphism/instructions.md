# OOP Example: Polymorphism

This example shows how different classes can have the same method name (`speak`) but behave differently.

- The `Dog` and `Cat` classes both extend `Animal` and override the `speak` method.
- When you call `speak` on each object, you get a different result.

Try clicking the button to see the different animal sounds!

**Explore:**
- Add another animal class with its own `speak` method.
- Try calling `speak` on an array of different animals.
