Write a program that calculates the amount a shop worker gets paid. Workers who are under 18 years old get paid £4.85 per hour, while those who are 18 years old or over get paid £6.35 per hour. The program should allow the user to enter an age in years and the number of hours worked. The program should display the number of hours worked and the total amount earned.
