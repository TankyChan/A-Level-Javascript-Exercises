## Task

A-level Computing has four modules. The modules and their marks are listed below:

- **COMP1** – 120
- **COMP2** – 80
- **COMP3** – 80
- **COMP4** – 120

The A2 grade is calculated from the total of all four marks a candidate has been awarded. The grade boundaries are listed below:

| Grade | Percentage         |
|-------|--------------------|
| A     | 80% or greater      |
| B     | 70% or greater      |
| C     | 60% or greater      |
| D     | 50% or greater      |
| E     | 40% or greater      |
| U     | Less than 40%       |

An **A*** is awarded to candidates who achieve an A grade and 90% or more in the A2 modules (COMP3 and COMP4).

Write a program that assigns a grade for A-Level Computing.
