## Exercise 1: Calculate Area of a Rectangle (Function with Return Value)

__Objective:__
In this exercise, you will create a function that calculates the area of a rectangle. The function will take the width and height as parameters and return the calculated area. The result will be displayed on the webpage.

### Instructions:

__HTML Structure:__

There are input fields to enter the width and height of the rectangle.
There is a button that, when clicked, will trigger the calculation.
The area will be displayed in the paragraph with the id="areaResult".

__JavaScript Task:__

Implement the calculateArea function to calculate the area of a rectangle.
The formula for the area of a rectangle is:
```
Area = width Ã— height
```

You need to extract the width and height values from the input fields, pass them to the calculateArea function, and display the result on the webpage.

__Steps:__

1. Define a function calculateArea(width, height) that calculates the area.
2. Add the logic to return the result of the area calculation.
3. Attach an event listener to the button that gets the values from the input fields, calls the calculateArea function, and displays the result in the <span id="areaResult">.

__What to Do:__

Implement the calculateArea function.
Test the application by entering different width and height values.
